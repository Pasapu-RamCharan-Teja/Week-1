✨ Demo Script – Garbage Classification Project (CNN)
1. Introduction

“Hello everyone, my name is P. RamCharan Teja. Today, I will be presenting my Garbage Classification Project, developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project aims to automatically classify waste into different categories to support efficient waste management.”

2. Project Structure Overview

“In this section, I will show you the project folder structure along with the README file, which explains how the model was built, how to run the application, and the dataset used.”

3. Running the Application

“To launch the application, I use the following command in the terminal:
streamlit run app.py

This will open the Streamlit web interface, where users can interact with the model.”

4. Uploading an Image

“Once the interface is open, I can upload any sample garbage image from the dataset.
After uploading, the model processes the image and predicts the corresponding waste category based on its training.”

5. Model Performance

“Here, I will display the training accuracy and loss graphs from the Jupyter Notebook. These plots show how the model improved over time and help evaluate its overall performance.”

6. Conclusion

“This concludes my demonstration of the Garbage Classification Project.
Thank you for watching.”
